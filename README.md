# Adventure Game
This is a "playground", built purely for myself, to test out various development ideas and practices. 

At this stage my goal is to grow this code base to a stage where I can start performing reletively advance database queries. 

The long term goal is to use this repo to demonstrate various development practices that I use on day-to-day.

## Roadmap
An idea of this game is to allow players to develop their own heros and fight NPC creatures.
